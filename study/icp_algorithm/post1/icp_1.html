            <h2>To begin with</h2>
            <p>
              This is a summary of the first part of the ICP & Point Cloud Registration series by Prof. Cyrill
              Stachniss. Lecture slides and videos are available on the

            <h2>What is ICP?</h2>
            <p>
              ICP stands for Iterative Closest Point. It is an algorithm to register two point clouds. Point cloud is a
              set of points in 3D space. Registration is a process of aligning two point clouds. What this algorithm
              does is better explained with a picture.
            </p>

              The <span class="color-red">red markers</span> indicate the first 2D Lidar scan and the
              <span class="color-green">green markers</span>
              indicate the second. Imagine we are in a self-driving car, and the Lidar sensor is scanning the
              environment. Intuitively, we understand that the car is moving forward because the dots appear to be
              moving backward. But here is the question for the car:
              <b>Where exactly is the car located, and how far has it actually moved?</b> These are fundamental question
              in the field of self-driving car and mobile robotics, since precise localization is tightly related with
              safety, efficiency, and accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is what ICP algorithm can solve. It estimates the transformation between the two point clouds. ICP is
              an iterative algorithm, which means it repeats the same process over and over again until it converges.
              The algorithm is as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Find the closest point in the second point cloud for each point in the first point cloud.</li>
              <li>Compute the transformation that aligns the first point cloud to the second point cloud.</li>
              <li>Apply the transformation to the first point cloud.</li>
              <li>Repeat until convergence.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The first step is called <b>data association</b>. The second step is called
              <b>transformation estimation</b> . The third step is called <b>transformation application</b>. The fourth
              step is called <b>convergence check</b>. In this post, we will focus on the first two steps.
            </p>
            <h2>Simple example</h2>
            <p>
              It is proven that there is a one-shot optimal solution for this alignment problem, as long as you get the
              correct correespondences. Let's see how it works.
