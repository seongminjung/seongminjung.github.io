            <h2>To Begin With</h2>
            <p>
              This is a summary of the first part of the ICP & Point Cloud Registration series by Prof. Cyrill
              Stachniss. Lecture slides and videos are available on the
              <a href="https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/index.html%3Fp=4424.html" target="_blank">course website</a> or his
              <a
                href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgnQpQtFTOGQh_J16IMwDlji18SWQ2PZ6&feature=shared"
                target="_blank"
                >YouTube channel</a
              >. Through this series, we will learn the basics of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and build
              the code from scratch.
            </p>
            <h2>What is ICP?</h2>
            <p>
              Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is an algorithm to register two point clouds. Point cloud is a set of points
              in 3D space, and registration is a process of aligning two point clouds. What this algorithm does is
              better explained with a picture.
            </p>
            <img class="half" src="/study/icp_algorithm/post1/img1.png" alt="What is ICP?" />
            <p>
              The <span class="color-red">red markers</span> indicate the first 2D Lidar scan and the
              <span class="color-green">green markers</span> indicate the second. Imagine we are in a self-driving car,
              and the Lidar sensor is scanning the environment. Intuitively, we understand that the car is moving
              forward because the dots appear to be moving backward. But here is the question for the car:
              <b>Where exactly is the car located, and how far has it actually moved?</b> These are fundamental question
              in the field of self-driving car and mobile robotics, since precise localization is tightly related with
              safety, efficiency, and accuracy.
            </p>

            <h3>In a Nutshell</h3>
            <p>
              ICP is a simple and strong algorithm for estimating the transformation between the two point clouds, which
              can be directly used to derive the past trajectory of the car or robot. The algorithm is as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Find the closest point in the second point cloud for each point in the first point cloud.</li>
              <li>Compute the transformation that aligns the first point cloud to the second point cloud.</li>
              <li>Apply the transformation to the first point cloud.</li>
              <li>Repeat 1-3 until convergence.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Through this series of posts, we will go through each step in detail. In this post, we will focus on
              computing the transformation given the perfectly matching pairs of points (correspondences).
            </p>

            <h2>Building From Scratch</h2>
            <h3>Software Setup</h3>
            <p>
              We will use <b>ROS noetic</b> with <b>C++</b> language. Detailed setup tutorial can be found in
              <a href="/study/ros1_robotics/post1/join_the_ros1_revolution.html" target="_blank">my previous posts</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Dataset</h3>
            <p>
              To keep things straightforward, we will utilize a basic handmade dataset for this post. We will create two
              point clouds, each with a small number of points. It has been proven that a
              <b>one-shot optimal solution exists</b> for this alignment problem, provided the
              <b>correct correspondences</b> are identified. Let's see how it works.
            </p>
            <img class="half" src="/study/icp_algorithm/post1/img2.png" alt="Dataset" />
            <p>
              In our setup, the <span class="color-red">red dots</span> depict the initial 2D point cloud, while the
              <span class="color-green">green dots</span> indicate the second point cloud. Our goal is to align these
              two sets: we'll use the red dots as our reference and carefully adjust the position of the green dots so
              they align perfectly with the red ones.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Terms and Parameters</h3>
            <p>
              Before we dive into the algorithm, let's define some key terms and parameters that will be used throughout
              this series. We will use the following notations:
            </p>

            <h4>Key Terms</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Correspondence</b>: A pair of points that are known to be the same. For the sake of simplicity, we
                artificially designate two points as corresponding if they share the same index, $i$. $x_i$ and $y_i$
                are the same point in different point cloud.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Registration</b>: The process of finding the rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ and translation vector
                $\mathbf{t}$ that aligns the two point clouds $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Parameters</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Reference (first) point cloud</b>: $\mathbf{Y} = \{y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_n\}$</li>
              <li><b>Incoming (second) point cloud</b>: $\mathbf{X} = \{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n\}$</li>
              <li><b>Rotation matrix and translation vector</b>: $\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$</li>
              <li><b>Transformed point cloud</b>: $\bar{\mathbf{X}} = \{\bar{x}_1, \bar{x}_2, \cdots, \bar{x}_n\}$</li>
            </ul>
            <img class="half" src="/study/icp_algorithm/post1/img3.png" alt="Dataset" />
            <p>
              Therefore, our dataset is defined as described above, consisting of corresponding points such as x1 and
              y1, x2 and y2, etc., which represent the same point observed from different locations. Note that the
              oordinate system used is x-forward and y-left.
            </p>

            <h2>One-Shot Optimal Solution</h2>
            <p>
              As mentioned earlier, it has been proven that a one-shot direct algorithm exists for registering two point
              clouds, provided the correct correspondences are known. The core technique utilized in this process is
              Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The procedure involves several key steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Determine the centroid for each point cloud.</li>
              <li>Shift both point clouds such that their centroids coincide with the origin.</li>
              <li>Construct the rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ that aligns the two point clouds.</li>
              <li>
                Shift both point clouds back to their initial positions and rotate the second point cloud by
                $\mathbf{R}$.
              </li>
              <li>Find the translation vector $\mathbf{t}$ that aligns the two point clouds.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Quite simple, isn't it? This direct method can be done only if the correct correspondences are known,
              which means that we know the first point cloud and the second point cloud are the same point observed from
              different locations. In the next section, we will derive the mathematical formulation for each step.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Determine the centroid for each point cloud.</h3>
            <p>
              The centroid of a point cloud is the average of all points in the point cloud. It can be computed as
              follows:
            </p>
            <p class="math-center">$x_0 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$</p>
            <p class="math-center">$y_0 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i$</p>

            <h3>2. Shift both point clouds such that their centroids coincide with the origin.</h3>
            <p>
              The centroid of each point cloud is subtracted from all points in the point cloud. This operation shifts
              the centroid to the origin.
            </p>
            <p class="math-center">$x_i = x_i - x_0$</p>
            <p class="math-center">$y_i = y_i - y_0$</p>

            <h3>3. Construct the rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ that aligns the two point clouds.</h3>
            <h4>
              3.1. Compute the covariance matrix $\mathbf{H}$ of the two point clouds $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$.
            </h4>
            <p>
              The covariance matrix $\mathbf{H}$ is a square matrix that contains the covariance between each pair of
              elements of a vector. The covariance between two elements $x_i$ and $y_i$ is computed as follows:
            </p>
            <p class="math-center">$cov(x_i, y_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - x_0)(y_i - y_0)$</p>
            <p>The covariance matrix $\mathbf{H}$ is computed as follows:</p>
            <p class="math-center">$\mathbf{H} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - x_0)(y_i - y_0)$</p>

            <h4>3.2. Construct the rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}$.</h4>
            <p>
              The rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ is constructed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD is a
              technique to decompose a matrix into three matrices, as follows:
            </p>
            <p class="math-center">$\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{D} \mathbf{V}^T$</p>
            <p>
              $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$ are orthogonal matrices, and $\mathbf{D}$ is a diagonal matrix. The diagonal
              elements of $\mathbf{D}$ are called singular values. The singular values are sorted in descending order.
              The first column of $\mathbf{U}$ is called the left singular vector, and the first column of $\mathbf{V}$
              is called the right singular vector. The left singular vector and the right singular vector are orthogonal
              to each other. The left singular vector and the right singular vector corresponding to the largest
              singular value are called the principal components. The principal components are the directions of the
              largest variance of the data. The principal components are also called the principal axes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ is constructed using the principal components of $\mathbf{X}$ and
              $\mathbf{Y}$ as follows:
            </p>
            <p class="math-center">$\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{U}^T$</p>

            <h3>
              4. Shift both point clouds back to their initial positions and rotate the second point cloud by
              $\mathbf{R}$.
            </h3>
            <p>The rotation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ is applied to the second point cloud $\mathbf{X}$ as follows:</p>
            <p class="math-center">$\bar{x}_i = \mathbf{R} x_i$</p>

            <h3>5. Find the translation vector $\mathbf{t}$ that aligns the two point clouds.</h3>
            <p>
              The translation vector $\mathbf{t}$ is computed as follows. The translation vector $\mathbf{t}$ is the
              difference between the centroid of the second point cloud $\mathbf{X}$ and the centroid of the rotated
              second point cloud $\bar{\mathbf{X}}$.
            </p>
            <p class="math-center">
              $\mathbf{t} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\bar{x}_i - x_i) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\mathbf{R} x_i -
              x_i)$
