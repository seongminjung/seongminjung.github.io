            <h2>Workspace</h2>
            <p>
              Before writing code in ROS, it is important to ensure that the code is in an appropriate location. The
              typical location for ROS code is as follows:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">~/workspace/src/package/src/executable.cpp</code></pre>
            <p>
              A workspace is a unit that is compiled at once, and it is necessary to organize your ROS code. You can
              create as many workspaces as you need and place them in any location that is convenient for you. In this
              guide, we will create a workspace named "blog_ws" in the home directory:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir -p ~/workspace_name/src</code></pre>
            <p>
              Make sure to create a "src" folder within the workspace. After creating the workspace, it is necessary to
              source the setup file:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash</code></pre>
            <p>
              This command is used to make the terminal recognize ROS. It should be executed in each new terminal where
              you want to use ROS.
            </p>

            <h2>Package</h2>
            <p>
              A package is a set of source files that is responsible for a particular function, such as organizing the
              shape of the robot, moving the robot, or mapping the surrounding environment. To create a package, change
              the directory to the "src" folder inside the workspace and use the following command:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">catkin_create_pkg package_name dependency1 dependency2</code></pre>
            <p>
              You can name the package as you wish. In this guide, we will name it "blog_pkg". Dependencies 1 and 2 are
              other package names referenced by this package. If you are using C++, it is recommended to add the package
              "roscpp" as the default dependency, and any other packages as needed.
            </p>

            <h2>Compile</h2>
            <p>
              Once the package is created, it can be compiled by changing the directory to the workspace and executing
              the following command:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">cd ..
catkin_make</code></pre>
            <p>
              If the compilation is successful, you will see two new folders created in the workspace folder. This
              indicates that the basic setup is complete, and you can begin writing code within the package.
            </p>

            <h2>Congrats!</h2>
            <p>
              Creating a workspace and package in ROS is a simple process that allows for organization and efficient
              code management. By following this guide, you should be able to set up your own workspace and package in
              ROS with ease.
