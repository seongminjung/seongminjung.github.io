            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <img class="half" src="/study/ros1_tutorial/ros_6/img1.png" alt="URDF file" />
            <p>
              URDF, or Unified Robot Description Format, is an XML file format used in ROS to describe the physical
              structure of a robot, including its links, joints, and sensors. URDF files are used by ROS to understand
              the structure of a robot and its movements, allowing ROS to control and visualize the robot. In this
              article, we will cover the basics of URDF files and how to define a robot model using an URDF file.
            </p>

            <h2>Create a new package</h2>
            <p>Create a new ROS package that depends on rviz, urdf, xacro, sensor_msgs, and geometry_msgs.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~/blog_ws/src
catkin_create_pkg my_robot rviz urdf xacro sensor_msgs geometry_msgs
cd my_robot
mkdir urdf
gedit urdf/&lt;filename&gt;.urdf</code></pre>
            <p>
              Save your URDF file inside urdf subdirectory. Yon can name the subdirectory as you want. The path should
              be like this: '~/workspace_name/src/package_name/urdf/filename.urdf'
            </p>

            <h2>How to define a robot model using an URDF file</h2>
            <p>
              Defining a robot model using an URDF file involves creating an XML file that describes the robot's
              structure, including its links, joints, and sensors. It is important to have a good understanding of the
              structure of your robot, including the link and joint relationships, to create an accurate URDF file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is an example of a simple URDF file for a robot with two links (base_link and end_effector) and one
              joint (joint1) connecting them:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;robot name="my_robot"&gt;
  &lt;link name="base_link"/&gt;
  &lt;link name="head"/&gt;
  &lt;joint name="base_link_head_joint" type="fixed"&gt;
    &lt;parent link="base_link"/&gt;
    &lt;child link="head"/&gt;
  &lt;/joint&gt;
&lt;/robot&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              In this example, the URDF file defines a robot with two links, "base_link" and "end_effector", and one
              joint, "joint1". The joint is defined as a continuous joint, meaning that it can rotate indefinitely. The
              parent link is set as "base_link" and the child link is set as "end_effector", connecting the two links
              together.
            </p>
            <p>Once you have created the URDF file, you can validate it by running the command:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">check_urdf &lt;path-to-urdf-file&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              This command will check for the consistency and the errors in your URDF file and if there are no errors,
              you are good to go. If check_urdf is not installed, use the following command to install it.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt install liburdfdom-dev liburdfdom-tools ros-noetic-urdfdom-py</code></pre>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              URDF files are an essential part of ROS, as they allow ROS to understand the structure of a robot and its
              movements. By understanding how to define a robot model using an URDF file, you will be able to more
              effectively work with ROS and control and visualize your robot.
