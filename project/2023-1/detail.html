                At <a href="https://www.cwrubotix.org/" target="_blank">CWRUBotix</a>, I developed an underwater ROV simulation for the MATE ROV World Championship
                2023. This involved using the Gazebo simulator and ROS to replicate real mission scenarios. The first
                challenge was buoyancy. With no water model in Gazebo, I adjusted the air density to 1000kg/m<sup

                >
                and fine-tuned the robot model's mass. Second, I precisely modeled the eight thrusters' power and blade
                arrangement, applying fluid dynamics principles. Lastly, I integrated ROS for maneuverability and
                stabilization, mirroring the actual robot's autopilot system. As a result, our simulation evolved into a
                realistic platform for testing mission execution.
