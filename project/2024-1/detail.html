                I enhanced pose tracking by integrating scene understanding. I utilized vertically oriented objects in
                urban settings, such as poles and trees, as landmarks. I created a 2D grid data structure that records
                the vertical extent of these objects, efficiently condensing the spatial information into a
                representative value. Then, I developed a pose-tracking algorithm based on 2D Iterative Closest Point
                (ICP). In the process, each cell was assigned a weight proportional to its height value, considering the
                significance of each cell's spatial contribution. This approach significantly reduced computational load
                while maintaining accuracy in relation to the 3D point cloud-based pose-tracking algorithms.
