          <h1>Isaac Sim Environment for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Systems</h1>
          <p>
            In this project, I built a heterogeneous multi-robot simulation environment using NVIDIA Isaac Sim,
            combining both ground and aerial robotic platforms within a single virtual scene. Each robot was configured
            with its own control stack and sensor setup through ROS, allowing realistic testing of navigation,
            perception, and coordination behaviors. On top of this simulation framework, I integrated the
            <a href="https://www.cmu-exploration.com/m-tare-planner" target="_blank">M-TARE</a>
            planner to enable autonomous exploration capabilities, allowing the robots to collaboratively explore
            unknown environments in real time. By simulating diverse robot types operating together with autonomous
            exploration and decision-making, this environment serves as a practical testbed for validating multi-robot
            systems before deploying them on real hardware.
