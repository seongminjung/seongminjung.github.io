          <h1>Neural SLAM with Point Cloud Projection for Faster RGB-D Tracking</h1>
          <p>
            Dense visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems have significantly advanced with the
            integration of learning-based scene representations. These representations enhance mapping fidelity and
            robustness to noise but are computationally expensive, particularly in repetitive rendering processes.
            Neural point cloud-based systems, despite their adaptability and state-of-the-art performance, suffer from
            time-intensive nearest-neighbor searches. We propose a novel projection-first rendering strategy that
            significantly improves processing speed for tracking, enabling real-time performance. Additionally, we
            introduce a direct occlusion detection mechanism leveraging keyframe depth information for efficient and
            accurate occlusion handling without requiring volume rendering. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic
            (Replica) and real-world (TUM-RGBD) datasets demonstrate that PoP-SLAM significantly improves tracking
            speed—-achieving around 4 frames per second—-as well as maintaining the superior tracking accuracy in the
            TUM-RGBD dataset.
