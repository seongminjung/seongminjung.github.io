          <h1>Height-embedded Iterative Closest Point (ICP)</h1>
          <p>
            I enhanced pose tracking by integrating scene understanding. I utilized vertically oriented objects in urban
            settings, such as poles and trees, as landmarks. I created a 2D grid data structure that records the
            vertical extent of these objects, efficiently condensing the spatial information into a representative
            value. Then, I developed a pose-tracking algorithm based on 2D Iterative Closest Point (ICP). In the
            process, each cell was assigned a weight proportional to its height value, considering the significance of
            each cell's spatial contribution. This approach significantly reduced computational load while maintaining
            accuracy in relation to the 3D point cloud-based pose-tracking algorithms.
