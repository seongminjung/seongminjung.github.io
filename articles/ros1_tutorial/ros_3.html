            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              ROS (Robot Operating System) is a powerful framework for building robotic systems. In order to effectively
              work with ROS, it's important to understand some key concepts that are central to the system. This
              includes topics, nodes, messages, and services.
            </p>
            <h2>Topics</h2>
            <p>
              A topic can be thought of as a bulletin board. Just as a person can post an article on a bulletin board
              for others to read, a node can publish data to a topic for other nodes to receive. Each topic has a
              specific name, and nodes can subscribe to a topic to receive the data that is being published to it.
              Topics are used for a variety of purposes, such as sending sensor data, sending control commands, and
              more.
            </p>
            <p>To see a list of active topics in the system, you can use the command:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">rostopic list</code></pre>
            <p>
              Make sure to run roscore beforehand. To see more detailed information about a specific topic, you can use
              the command:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">rostopic info &lt;topic_name&gt;</code></pre>

            <h2>Nodes</h2>
            <p>
              A node can be thought of as a person. Just as a person can post an article on a bulletin board or read an
              article on a bulletin board, a node can publish data to a topic or subscribe to a topic to receive data.
              Each node performs a specific function, such as processing sensor data or sending control commands. Nodes
              communicate with each other through topics and services.
            </p>
            <p>To see a list of currently running nodes, you can use the command:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">rosnode list</code></pre>
            <p>To see more detailed information about a specific node, you can use the command:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">rosnode info &lt;node_name&gt;</code></pre>

            <h2>Messages</h2>
            <p>
              A message can be thought of as the article that is posted on the bulletin board. Just as an article has a
              specific format, such as a title, author, and content, a message also has a specific format. The format of
              a message can include various data types, such as integers, floating point numbers, and strings.
            </p>
            <p>To see a list of available message types in the system, you can use the command:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">rosmsg list</code></pre>
            <p>To see more detailed information about a specific message type, you can use the command:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">rosmsg show &lt;message_type&gt;</code></pre>

            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p>
              A service is a way for nodes to request a specific action or receive a specific piece of information from
              another node, using a specific request-response format defined by a service definition file.
            </p>
            <p>To see a list of available services in the system, you can use the command:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">rosservice list</code></pre>
            <p>To see more detailed information about a specific service, you can use the command:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">rosservice info &lt;service_name&gt;</code></pre>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <img class="half" src="/articles/ros1_tutorial/ros_3/img1.webp" alt="Conclusion" />
            <p>
              In conclusion, understanding the concepts of topics, nodes, messages, and services is essential for
              working effectively with ROS. By understanding these concepts, you can more easily navigate and work
              within the ROS ecosystem. The analogy of a person and a bulletin board can help to illustrate the
              relationships between topics and nodes, and make the concepts more relatable and intuitive.
