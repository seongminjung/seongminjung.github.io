            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <img class="half" src="/articles/ros1_tutorial/ros_5/img1.png" alt="bashrc file" />
            <p>
              When working with ROS, you may find yourself frequently needing to source the setup files in order to use
              ROS commands in the terminal. This can become tedious and time-consuming, especially if you are constantly
              switching between terminals or starting new terminals. To avoid having to manually source the setup files
              every time, you can set up the bashrc file to automatically source the files when you open a new terminal.
            </p>

            <h2>Editing the bashrc file</h2>
            <p>
              The bashrc file is a script that is run every time you start a new terminal. It is used to set up various
              environment variables and run commands. To edit the bashrc file, you can use a text editor such as nano or
              vim.
            </p>
            <p>First, open the bashrc file by running the following command:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">nano ~/.bashrc</code></pre>
            <p>
              This will open the bashrc file in the nano text editor. You can also use vi or vim if you're more
              comfortable with it.
            </p>
            <p>At the end of the file, add the following line:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">source /opt/ros/&lt;distro&gt;/setup.bash</code></pre>
            <p>Replace &lt;distro&gt; with your ROS distribution, for example noetic or melodic.</p>
            <p>
              Additionally, when working with workspaces, you may also need to source the setup file located in the
              “devel” folder of your workspace. The command for this is:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-bash">source ~/blog_ws/devel/setup.bash</code></pre>
            <p>Replace "blog_ws" with the name of your workspace.</p>
            <p>Save and close the file by pressing CTRL+X, then Y, then ENTER.</p>
            <p>
              The next time you open a new terminal, the setup files will be automatically sourced and you will be able
              to use ROS commands without having to manually source the files.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alternatively, you can also add the above command to your .bash_profile in case you are working on a macOS
              or Linux system that uses this file instead of .bashrc
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also worth noting that if you are working on a Windows system, you will have to add the above
              command to your .bashrc file in your Windows subsystem Linux (WSL) home directory, usually
              /home/&lt;username&gt;/.bashrc
            </p>
            <p>
              To build and run the node, navigate to the root of your catkin workspace and run the following command:
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              In conclusion, setting up the bashrc file can automate the process of sourcing the ROS setup files and
              streamline your workflow when working with ROS. Additionally, when working with catkin workspaces, it is
              important to also source the setup file located in the "devel" folder. By properly configuring the bashrc
              file, you can ensure a smooth and efficient experience when working with ROS.
