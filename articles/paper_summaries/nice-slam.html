            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              In order to make a SLAM system useful for real-world applications, the following properties are essential:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Real-time performance</li>
              <li>Ability to predict unseen areas</li>
              <li>Scalability</li>
              <li>Robustness</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              However, traditional SLAM systems are unable to make plausible estimation for unobserved regions. On the
              other hand, learning-based SLAM systems lack scalability.
            </p>
            <p>
              This paper found multi-level grid-based features can help to address the scalability issue. Therefore,
              this paper combines hierarchical scene representation with neural implicit representations to achieve the
              desired properties above.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key idea is to represent the scene geometry and appearance with hierarchical feature grids and
              incorporate the inductive biases of neural implicit decoders pretrained at different spatial resolutions.
            </p>

            <h4>Dense Visual SLAM</h4>
            <p>
              Traditional SLAM systems store occupancy or TSDF values in voxel grids. However, these representations
              cannot predict unseen areas. NICE-SLAM also adopts the voxel-grid representation, however, NICE-SLAM
              stores implicit latent codes of the geometry and directly optimize them.
            </p>

            <h4>Neural Implicit Representations</h4>
            <p>
              Neural implicit representations are good at predicting and representing object geometry and appearance.
              However, some assume given camera poses and others are not suitable for real-time applications. iMAP
              shares the same goal as NICE-SLAM, but they use single MLP to represent the entire scene, which causes the
              forgetting issue. DI-Fusion also uses a feature grid, but it contains holes and tracking is not robust.
              NICE-SLAM can handle large-scale scenes and is robust to challenging scenarios.
            </p>

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <img src="/articles/paper_summaries/nice-slam/img1.png" alt="System Overview" />

            <h4>Hierarchical Scene Representation</h4>
            <p>
              The scene geometry is encoded into total four feature grids: 1) coarse-level, 2) mid-level, 3) fine-level,
              4) scene appearance. Four pre-trained neural implicit decoders are attached to each feature grid. These
              feature grids themselves act as the map.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, the system extracts the occupancy values by decoding the latent codes from the mid-level grid.
              Then, the system refines the geometry by decoding the latent codes from the fine-level grid.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, the coarse-level grid is used to predict the appoximate occupancy values of the unseen areas. It
              aims to capture high-level geometry, such as walls and floors. The occupancy values are also decoded from
              the feature grid. The optimization of this coarse-level grid is independent from the other grids.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pre-training is done as a part of ConvONet. These pre-trained decoders are frozen during the training
              process to stabilize the optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Color information provides additional cues for tracking. Color is decoded by its own decoder from the
              color feature grid. However, the color of the entire scene is represented by one decoder MLP, which may
              lead to the forgetting issue.
            </p>

            <h4>Depth and Color Rendering</h4>
            <p>
              The system uses a differentiable rendering process, similar to NeRF, to integrate the predicted occupancy
              and colors from the hierarchical feature grids. It first performs stratified sampling along the viewing
              ray, and also performs uniform sampling near the object surface.
            </p>
            <p>
              For every point, their coarse-level occupancy probability, fine-level occupancy probability, and color are
              computed using the pre-trained MLPs. Then, along the ray, the depth and color are integrated as the NeRF
              system does.
            </p>
