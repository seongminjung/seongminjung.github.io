                I enhanced pose tracking by integrating scene understanding. I utilized vertically oriented objects in
                urban settings, such as poles and trees, as landmarks. I created an innovative 2D grid data structure
                that records the vertical extent of these objects, efficiently condensing the spatial information into a
                representative value. Then, I developed a novel pose-tracking algorithm based on 2D Iterative Closest
                Point (ICP). In the process, each cell was assigned a weight proportional to its height value,
                considering the significance of each cell's spatial contribution. This approach significantly reduced
                computational load while maintaining accuracy in relation to the 3D point cloud-based pose-tracking
                algorithms.

              <h2>Agile Autonomous Navigation</h2>
              <img class="preview" src="/project/project2/preview.png" alt="preview" />
              <p class="detail">
                In my undergraduate thesis, I led the software development of an agile autonomous navigation system
                based on scene understanding, without relying on traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
                (SLAM). Our approach combined local path planning with path integration, allowing navigation toward the
                goal while avoiding obstacles. As a testing robot, we mounted a 2D LiDAR on a remote-controlled model
                car. I created an algorithm for line detection and obstacle clustering from the laser scan. This simple
                scene understanding facilitated the computation of optimal paths with reduced computational demands. I
                also elaborated a path integration algorithm by adopting an equation correlating the car's steering
                angle with the rotation radius. As a result, our robot reached an impressive average speed of 2m/s,
                while SLAM-based methods could move only a few centimeters per second in the same condition.

              <img class="preview" src="/project/project1/preview.png" alt="preview" />
              <p class="detail">
                At CWRUbotix, I developed a realistic underwater robot simulation for the MATE ROV World Championship
                2023. This involved using the Gazebo simulator and ROS to replicate real mission scenarios. The first
                challenge was buoyancy. With no water model in Gazebo, I adjusted the air density to 1000kg/m<sup
                  >3</sup
                >
                and fine-tuned the robot model's mass. Second, I precisely modeled the eight thrusters' power and blade
                arrangement, applying fluid dynamics principles. Lastly, I integrated ROS for maneuverability and
                stabilization, mirroring the actual robot's autopilot system. As a result, our simulation evolved into a
                realistic platform for testing mission execution.
